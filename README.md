# Alcohol EDU Statistical Significance Test
Simulation test used in qualitative policy proposal.


For the class Qualitative Research Methods, our class researched drinking culture at Pitzer college. During the semester I conducted field notes at campus parties and in-depth interviews.The research project was prompted by the results of a quantitative survey called "Alcohol EDU." I created a simulation test of the event, in order to check the statistical significance of the survey results. The test shows that the increase in problemactic drinkers and the decrease in nondrinkers at Pitzer College during the first 3 months of freshman year is statistically significant at an alpha level of .05. The quanitative results reaffirm the value of our qualitative study.

A PDF of the results can be found [here](https://github.com/jdegrootlutzner/alc_edu_stat_test/blob/master/alc-edu-statistical-significance/significance_test.pdf).
