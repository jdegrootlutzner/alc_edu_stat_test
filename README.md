# Alcohol EDU Statistical Significance Test
Simulation test used in qualitative policy proposal.


For the class Qualitative Research Methods, our class researched drinking culture at Pitzer college. During the semester I conducted field notes at campus parties and in-depth interviews. The research project was prompted by the results of a quantitative survey called "Alcohol EDU." In order to check the statistical significance of the survey results,  I created a simulation test based on the national averages. The results of the significance test show that the percent increase in problemactic drinkers and the percent decrease in nondrinkers at Pitzer College during the first 3 months of freshman year are both statistically significant at an alpha level of .05. The statistical significance of these results reaffirm the value of our qualitative study. Qualitative research can be use to help explain quantiative observations.

The statiscial significane test can be found [here](https://github.com/jdegrootlutzner/alc_edu_stat_test/blob/master/alc-edu-statistical-significance/significance_test.pdf).
